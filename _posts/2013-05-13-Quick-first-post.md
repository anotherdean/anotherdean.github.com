Q: What's worst than having to write a first post?
A: Writing the first post, when you don't know what you'll use the blog for.

Indeed, indeed. I think we've all been there. Or maybe it's just me that buys a domain name, hooks it up to Joomla! or Wordpress and then realizes he's got no effin' clue what he's going to write about. Anyone? Just me? Okay... That's not akward, at all.
